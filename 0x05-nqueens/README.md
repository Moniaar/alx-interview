# N Queens Problem: Concept
### In the Mathematics and Computer Science Context:

## Mathematics Perspective:

The N Queens problem is a classic combinatorial problem in mathematics. It involves placing N queens on an NÃ—N chessboard such that no two queens threaten each other.
A queen can move any number of squares along a row, column, or diagonal. Hence, the problem reduces to ensuring that no two queens share the same row, column, or diagonal.
The problem's significance lies in its combinatorial nature and the insights it provides into algorithm design and optimization.
## Computer Science Perspective:

In computer science, the N Queens problem is often used to illustrate the concept of backtracking, a general algorithmic technique for solving constraint satisfaction problems.
Backtracking involves exploring possible solutions and abandoning them ("backtracking") if they do not satisfy the problem's constraints.
The N Queens problem is a canonical example used to teach recursive algorithms, constraint propagation, and the importance of efficient search strategies in solving complex problems.
